# R-P-S

### Description

A fun little computer game of "Rock, Paper, Scissor" that I did for a class assignment. Interactive and fun. Prompts user to choose between " R, P, S" and displays what user has chosen. Then generates a random computer answer, displays computer's choice, and checks to see who won the round. After will display the user's stat for the game and will display them. Lastly it wil ask the user if they want to play again. If they choose yes, the game will run again, if not it close the game.

## Languages

For now is running on a simple HTML layout and JavaScript but will make future CSS changes to make it a bit more appealing.
